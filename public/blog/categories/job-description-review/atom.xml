<p>
In this series, I invite a qualified engineer/developer with matching or related technical background to review a real job description.  In these reviews, you'll learn the unfiltered feedback and thoughts from the technical people who are the target readers of these job descriptions.  <em>Please note: each review reflects only the opinion of the specific reviewer.</em>
</p>

<p><strong>Please give us your career summary.</strong></p>


<p>
I'm a software engineer with 6 years of experience - 3 years at startups and 3 at a big company. Technology summary:
<ul>
<li>web development - Ruby on Rails</li>
<li>mobile development - iOS development</li>
<li>distributed systems</li>
<li>C++</li>
</ul>
</p>




<p><strong>
If you were to get a new job today, what would it be?
</strong></p>




<p>
I am very interested in and would look for the following types of roles:
<ul>
<li>Product development - from concept to implementation</li>
<li>Software devevelopment - the actual implementation / coding</li>
</ul>
</p>




<p><strong>
How would you go about conducting your job search?
</strong></p>


<p>
<ol>
<li>Ask my mentors, friends, and personal contacts first</li>
<li>Change my LinkedIn profile to show that I'm available so that recruiters will reach out</li>
<li>Reach out to recruiters that I've worked with / met before</li>
<li>Conduct an online job search, especially funded startups</li>
</ol>
</p>




<p><strong>
When you do an online search, how would you do it?
</strong></p>


<p>
I have <strong>a list of startups</strong> that I came across before and am interested in.
<a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs">
<strong>StackOverflow</strong></a> is good for knowing which local startups are hiring and doing interesting stuff.  I also look at
<a href="http://www.geekwire.com/jobs/"><strong>GeekWire's job board</strong></a> for starutp jobs.
I would look at Craigslist, but I haven't had good luck there - too much spam there.
</p>


<p>
Basically, I would start with job boards that have high percentage of jobs I'm interestd in (i.e. startup jobs).  It was interesting to see Amazon jobs on StackOverflow.  I would use StackOverflow to discover big companies as well.
</p>


<p>
I don't use keywords to search.  I just browse.
</p>




<p><strong>
Let’s find a job description.  Please tell me what comes to your mind.
</strong></p>


<p>
Okay, here's one that was sent to me by a recruiter - an iOS mobile app development contract position.
</p>


<p></p>
<img src="/images/blog_imgs/ios_march_2013_part_1.png" title="iOS Developer part 1" ></p>

<p>
<p>
I don't want to read this part (<em>About Us</em> and <em>About Our Culture</em>) at this point.  They shouldn't put this at the beginning.  I will only look at this later if I am interested about this position.
</p>

</p>


<p><img src="/images/blog_imgs/ios_march_2013_part_2.png" title="iOS Developer part 2" ></p>

<p>
To develop a mobile app for this well-known luxury retailer is exciting because the number of potential users can be huge.  However, the offshore-onshore combo is a turn-off for me because I have been in that situation before and it didn't work well.  Also, the requirement to be on-site is not attractive to me.  As a contractor, I'd prefer to work remotely.
</p>


<p>
Something that is not clear to me is what <em>other native API integration</em> means.
</p>


<p>
In general, this part (<em>About the client and assignment</em>) of the job description is what I would read very carefully.
</p>


<p></p>
<img src="/images/blog_imgs/ios_march_2013_part_3.png" title="iOS Developer part 3" ></p>

<p>

<p>
I only scan the <em>Required Skills</em> part.  Mostly I only look at the top 3 items.  For example, the 4th item, the Cocoa requirement, should be moved to the 2nd position.
</p>
<p>
The UI design requirement (the 2nd item) should be moved to a lower position if it's not a hard requirement.  Being the 2nd item on the list, it signals to me this job is more front-end and design-focused than the typical iOS development role.
</p>
<p>
I like seeing Test-Driven Development here because it's a rare, but important, skill to have.
</p>
<p>
I pretty much ignore the whole <em>Personal Skills</em> part because it's all just stardard stuff.  Every single job descriptioin says the same thing.
</p>

Please rate this job description.

<p>My overall rating: <strong>Average</strong></p>

Interest-level heat map of this job description for this engineer:</strong>
(Yellow - interesting.  Grey - not interesting.)

<p>
In this series, I invite someone to review a real job description with matching or related technical background.  In these reviews, you'll learn the unfiltered feedback and thoughts from the technical people who are the target readers of these job descriptions.  Please note: each review reflects only the opinion of the specific reviewer.
</p>


<!-- More -->


<p><strong>Please give us your career summary.</strong></p>


<p>
My expertise and interests
<ul>
<li>Mobile development</li>
<li>Startup environment</li>
<li>Multi-media</li>
<li>Monetization techniques</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p>My past experience includes</p>

<ul>
<li>QA engineering team building</li>
<li>Windows development</li>
<li>Mac application development</li>
<li>7 years at MS Windows group</li>
</ul>




<p><strong>
What type of jobs are you looking for today? How is it different from your last job?
</strong></p>




<p>
I am looking for positions as such Engineering Manager or Product Manager.  I want to work in a smaller environment because of the variety of work, opportunity to learn, and ability to switch roles (such as from engineering to product management).  What is very important to me is super low barrier to communication and learning.  By this I mean I can easily interact with other roles on the team and within the company.
</p>




<p><strong>
How do you go about conducting your job search?
</strong></p>


<p>
I use Craigslist.  Three of my previous jobs were found via Craigslist.  This time I interviewed for a position at Amazon because of their Craigslist posting.  I didn’t look elsewhere.
</p>




<p><strong>
Why do you like using Craigslist?
</strong></p>


<p>
I feel company websites are too narrow.  I want to see the overall job market and the variety on Craigslist can give me a better idea.  Craigslist is most convenient for me and it has enough positions that I’m interested in, so I don’t feel the need to use job boards or LinkedIn.
</p>


<p>
The reason I don’t use job board or LinkedIn is because
<ol>
<li>Creating accounts at different job boards is a hassle</li>
<li>I’m concerned about privacy and security issues (i.e. my search/view history might be shown).</li>
</ol>
</p>


<p><strong>
How do you find job postings online?
</strong></p>


<p>
I don’t use any keyword search.  I go to Craigslist to scan for interesting items.  Even though I’m looking for engineering manager level positions, I will look at jobs at companies that are doing interesting work.  Then I will go to that company’s own career site to find out more.
</p>


<p><strong>
Let’s find a job description.  Please tell me what comes to your mind.
</strong></p>


<p>
Okay, let’s go to Craigslist.  The top job posting happens to be a QA role, which matches my background.
</p>


<p>
(After about 20 seconds scanning this job description)  Here are the three things that stand out for me:
</p>


<p><img src="/images/blog_imgs/QA_JD.png" title="What Stands Out" ></p>

<p>
<ol>
<li>Virtual Machine Engine: It's an interesting technology to me.</li>
<li>Virtualization and Coding Theory: Once again, I'm interested in the technology.</li>
<li>Company info: It's good to know the company is profitable, have lots of users and the type of users the company has.</li>
</ol>
</p>


<p>
Everything else is just standard stuff and is pretty boring.
</p>


<p><strong>

<p>My overall rating: Average of below average - nothing too exciting.</p>
