<p>
In this series, I invite a qualified engineer/developer with matching or related technical background to review a real job description.  In these reviews, you'll learn the unfiltered feedback and thoughts from the technical people who are the target readers of these job descriptions.  <em>Please note: each review reflects only the opinion of the specific reviewer.</em>
</p>

<p><strong>Please give us your career summary.</strong></p>


<p>
I'm a software engineer with 6 years of experience - 3 years at startups and 3 at a big company. Technology summary:
<ul>
<li>web development - Ruby on Rails</li>
<li>mobile development - iOS development</li>
<li>distributed systems</li>
<li>C++</li>
</ul>
</p>




<p><strong>
If you were to get a new job today, what would it be?
</strong></p>




<p>
I am very interested in and would look for the following types of roles:
<ul>
<li>Product development - from concept to implementation</li>
<li>Software devevelopment - the actual implementation / coding</li>
</ul>
</p>




<p><strong>
How would you go about conducting your job search?
</strong></p>


<p>
<ol>
<li>Ask my mentors, friends, and personal contacts first</li>
<li>Change my LinkedIn profile to show that I'm available so that recruiters will reach out</li>
<li>Reach out to recruiters that I've worked with / met before</li>
<li>Conduct an online job search, especially funded startups</li>
</ol>
</p>




<p><strong>
When you do an online search, how would you do it?
</strong></p>


<p>
I have <strong>a list of startups</strong> that I came across before and am interested in.
<a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs">
<strong>StackOverflow</strong></a> is good for knowing which local startups are hiring and doing interesting stuff.  I also look at
<a href="http://www.geekwire.com/jobs/"><strong>GeekWire's job board</strong></a> for starutp jobs.
I would look at Craigslist, but I haven't had good luck there - too much spam there.
</p>


<p>
Basically, I would start with job boards that have high percentage of jobs I'm interestd in (i.e. startup jobs).  It was interesting to see Amazon jobs on StackOverflow.  I would use StackOverflow to discover big companies as well.
</p>


<p>
I don't use keywords to search.  I just browse.
</p>




<p><strong>
Letâ€™s find a job description.  Please tell me what comes to your mind.
</strong></p>


<p>
Okay, here's one that was sent to me by a recruiter - an iOS mobile app development contract position.
</p>


<p></p>
<img src="/images/blog_imgs/ios_march_2013_part_1.png" title="iOS Developer part 1" ></p>

<p>
<p>
I don't want to read this part (<em>About Us</em> and <em>About Our Culture</em>) at this point.  They shouldn't put this at the beginning.  I will only look at this later if I am interested about this position.
</p>

</p>


<p><img src="/images/blog_imgs/ios_march_2013_part_2.png" title="iOS Developer part 2" ></p>

<p>
To develop a mobile app for this well-known luxury retailer is exciting because the number of potential users can be huge.  However, the offshore-onshore combo is a turn-off for me because I have been in that situation before and it didn't work well.  Also, the requirement to be on-site is not attractive to me.  As a contractor, I'd prefer to work remotely.
</p>


<p>
Something that is not clear to me is what <em>other native API integration</em> means.
</p>


<p>
In general, this part (<em>About the client and assignment</em>) of the job description is what I would read very carefully.
</p>


<p></p>
<img src="/images/blog_imgs/ios_march_2013_part_3.png" title="iOS Developer part 3" ></p>

<p>

<p>
I only scan the <em>Required Skills</em> part.  Mostly I only look at the top 3 items.  For example, the 4th item, the Cocoa requirement, should be moved to the 2nd position.
</p>
<p>
The UI design requirement (the 2nd item) should be moved to a lower position if it's not a hard requirement.  Being the 2nd item on the list, it signals to me this job is more front-end and design-focused than the typical iOS development role.
</p>
<p>
I like seeing Test-Driven Development here because it's a rare, but important, skill to have.
</p>
<p>
I pretty much ignore the whole <em>Personal Skills</em> part because it's all just stardard stuff.  Every single job descriptioin says the same thing.
</p>


<p><strong>
Please rate this job description.
