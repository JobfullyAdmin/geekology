If you are a software developer looking for a contract or full-time job with companies like Microsoft, Amazon, etc., you've probably been approached by enough recruiters that asked you if you'd be interested in working as an SDET. Your first reaction might have been - Testing? No way. <!-- More --> Then, they start talking about how it involves a lot of coding and now you think, "Now, that's different from what I thought about testing."
</p>




<p>
If you are a technical recruiter, you might also be a bit unclear about what exactly is a SDET.  You might be wondering, "Is SDET same as a tester?"  But, SDETs seem to be requiring just as much coding as software engineers.  Then you ask yourself, "What skills am I supposed to look for when my hiring manager is looking for a SDET?"
</p>




<p>
To help demystify SDET, here is a collection of articles that explain what an SDET is and does:

<h2>A Great Summary by Seth Eliot</h2>


<p>
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/seliot/archive/2010/04/21/what-is-an-sdet-part-2.aspx">Seth Eliot's blog on MSDN</a> was particularly useful for both developers and recruiters because it gave a concise and insightful summary:
</p>


<p><em></p>

<h3>What is an SDE-T?</h3>


<ul>
  <li>Programming experience a must
  <ul>
    <li>Key here is that the candidate is a Developer. Strong QA candidates without development experience are generally not acceptable for this role.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<ul>
  <li>Test Automation
    <ul>
      <li>Writing code to test code: UI and API level testing</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <li>Creating, modifying, or designing test frameworks</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Good: Selenium, JUnit, NUnit, TestNG, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Using &ldquo;canned&rdquo; products like QuickTest Pro, TestDirector, SilkTest is generally *not* sufficient</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<ul>
  <li>SDLC and Software Processes
    <ul>
      <li>Agile/Scrum a plus</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<ul>
  <li>QA interest / enthusiasm / experience
    <ul>
      <li>Created Test Cases, Test Plans</li>
      <li>Debug / troubleshoot issues that they found (deep dive)</li>
      <li>Bug reporting / triage / prioritization</li>
      <li>Was responsible for guiding quality on production release</li>
      <li>Functional, load, stress, user interaction testing</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<ul>
  <li>Customer focus
    <ul>
      <li>Customer facing experience a plus</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<ul>
  <li>"Soft" Skills 
    <ul>
      <li>Communication </li>
      <li>Driving consensus </li>
      <li>Leadership </li>
      <li>Creativity</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<ul>
  <li>Technologies 
    <ul>
      <li>Must have experience programming a high-level OO language (C#, Java, C++, or C#) 
        <ul>
          <li>C#/.NET experience highly preferred</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>RDBMS, SQL, stored procedures. SQL Server preferred. </li>
      <li>Web technologies: HTML, JavaScript, web services, XML, CSS</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<h3>How to sell the SDE-T role to a developer</h3>


<ul>
  <li>Breadth of experience over narrow focus </li>
  <li>End to end product expertise. From development to user interaction </li>
  <li>Subject Matter Expert on product. Has input on product direction. </li>
  <li>Career &ldquo;big fish in a small pond&rdquo;&hellip; a strong contributor can really make a name for him or herself. Easier than in Dev because do not get &ldquo;pigeon holed&rdquo; and because the QA field is more exclusive.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In this series, I invite someone to review a real job description with matching or related technical background.  In these reviews, you'll learn the unfiltered feedback and thoughts from the technical people who are the target readers of these job descriptions.  Please note: each review reflects only the opinion of the specific reviewer.
</p>


<!-- More -->


<p><strong>Please give us your career summary.</strong></p>


<p>
My expertise and interests
<ul>
<li>Mobile development</li>
<li>Startup environment</li>
<li>Multi-media</li>
<li>Monetization techniques</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p>My past experience includes</p>

<ul>
<li>QA engineering team building</li>
<li>Windows development</li>
<li>Mac application development</li>
<li>7 years at MS Windows group</li>
</ul>




<p><strong>
What type of jobs are you looking for today? How is it different from your last job?
</strong></p>




<p>
I am looking for positions as such Engineering Manager or Product Manager.  I want to work in a smaller environment because of the variety of work, opportunity to learn, and ability to switch roles (such as from engineering to product management).  What is very important to me is super low barrier to communication and learning.  By this I mean I can easily interact with other roles on the team and within the company.
</p>




<p><strong>
How do you go about conducting your job search?
</strong></p>


<p>
I use Craigslist.  Three of my previous jobs were found via Craigslist.  This time I interviewed for a position at Amazon because of their Craigslist posting.  I didn’t look elsewhere.
</p>




<p><strong>
Why do you like using Craigslist?
</strong></p>


<p>
I feel company websites are too narrow.  I want to see the overall job market and the variety on Craigslist can give me a better idea.  Craigslist is most convenient for me and it has enough positions that I’m interested in, so I don’t feel the need to use job boards or LinkedIn.
</p>


<p>
The reason I don’t use job board or LinkedIn is because
<ol>
<li>Creating accounts at different job boards is a hassle</li>
<li>I’m concerned about privacy and security issues (i.e. my search/view history might be shown).</li>
</ol>
</p>


<p><strong>
How do you find job postings online?
</strong></p>


<p>
I don’t use any keyword search.  I go to Craigslist to scan for interesting items.  Even though I’m looking for engineering manager level positions, I will look at jobs at companies that are doing interesting work.  Then I will go to that company’s own career site to find out more.
</p>


<p><strong>
Let’s find a job description.  Please tell me what comes to your mind.
</strong></p>


<p>
Okay, let’s go to Craigslist.  The top job posting happens to be a QA role, which matches my background.
</p>


<p>
(After about 20 seconds scanning this job description)  Here are the three things that stand out for me:
</p>


<p><img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3131770/QA_JD.png" title="What Stands Out" ></p>

<p>
<ol>
<li>Virtual Machine Engine: It's an interesting technology to me.</li>
<li>Virtualization and Coding Theory: Once again, I'm interested in the technology.</li>
<li>Company info: It's good to know the company is profitable, have lots of users and the type of users the company has.</li>
</ol>
</p>


<p>
Everything else is just standard stuff and is pretty boring.
</p>


<p><strong>
Please rate this job description.
</strong></p>


<p>My overall rating: Average of below average - nothing too exciting.</p>
