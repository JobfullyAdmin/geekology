In this <em>&#8220;Geek Language Quiz&#8221;</em> series, we&#8217;ll list some commonly asked questions about technical terms, especially for recruiting purposes, and their answers.  Test and score yourself on your understanding of the Geek language.  Have fun!
</p>

<p>
<em>Q. How are Java and JavaScript related?</em>
</br>
<em>A. </em>They are not at all related.  Java is an general-purpose programming language.  JavaScript is most commonly used for interacting with end users, such as in a web application users see in a browser.
</p>




<p>
<em>Q. What is so-called Open Source Software?</em>
</br>
<em>A. </em>Open Source Software, as opposed to Closed Source or Proprietary Software, is computer software with its source code made available and licensed with an open-source license in which the copyright holder provides the rights to study, change and distribute the software for free to anyone and for any purpose.
</p>




<p>
<em>Q. What’s the difference between SDE and SDET?</em>
</br>
<em>A. </em>
SDE stands for Software Development Engineer.  SDET stands for Software Development Engineer in Test.  Both roles are software developers.  SDEs write code for software systems that will be used by the target end users.  SDETs write code to automate testing against software systems SDEs created and to identify and report defects (i.e. bugs).
</p>




<p>
<em>Q. Are UI and UX the same or different?</em>
</br>
<em>A. </em>
UX (i.e. user experience) is the overall experience one has with a product or service. UI (i.e. user interface) is typically a combination of visual design (the look and feel) and the interaction design (how it works). UI can be a component of UX, but many user experiences don&#8217;t have UIs.
</p>




<p>
<em>Q. What does “Object-Oriented Programming” mean?</em>
</br>
<em>A. </em>
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that represents concepts as &#8220;objects&#8221; with nouns (data) and verbs (actions).  The main benefit of using Object-Oriented Programming is that it&#8217;s one way of breaking complex problems into more manageable ones.
</p>




<p>
<em>Q. What kind of architecture does a software architect build?</em>
</br>
<em>A. </em>
Software architecture is not a well-defined term, even among the software engineering community.  To date, there is still no agreement on the precise definition of software architecture.  One way to define software architecture is a roadmap that defines the strategic software design decisions, based on known constraints and requirements.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>iOS Developer (Seattle)</h2>


<p>
In this series, I invite a qualified engineer/developer with matching or related technical background to review a real job description.  In these reviews, you&#8217;ll learn the unfiltered feedback and thoughts from the technical people who are the target readers of these job descriptions.  <em>Please note: each review reflects only the opinion of the specific reviewer.</em>
</p>

<p><strong>Please give us your career summary.</strong></p>


<p>
I&#8217;m a software engineer with 6 years of experience - 3 years at startups and 3 at a big company. Technology summary:
<ul>
<li>web development - Ruby on Rails</li>
<li>mobile development - iOS development</li>
<li>distributed systems</li>
<li>C++</li>
</ul>
</p>




<p><strong>
If you were to get a new job today, what would it be?
</strong></p>




<p>
I am very interested in and would look for the following types of roles:
<ul>
<li>Product development - from concept to implementation</li>
<li>Software devevelopment - the actual implementation / coding</li>
</ul>
</p>




<p><strong>
How would you go about conducting your job search?
</strong></p>


<p>
<ol>
<li>Ask my mentors, friends, and personal contacts first</li>
<li>Change my LinkedIn profile to show that I&#8217;m available so that recruiters will reach out</li>
<li>Reach out to recruiters that I&#8217;ve worked with / met before</li>
<li>Conduct an online job search, especially funded startups</li>
</ol>
</p>




<p><strong>
When you do an online search, how would you do it?
</strong></p>


<p>
I have <strong>a list of startups</strong> that I came across before and am interested in.
<a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs">
<strong>StackOverflow</strong></a> is good for knowing which local startups are hiring and doing interesting stuff.  I also look at
<a href="http://www.geekwire.com/jobs/"><strong>GeekWire&#8217;s job board</strong></a> for starutp jobs.
I would look at Craigslist, but I haven&#8217;t had good luck there - too much spam there.
</p>


<p>
Basically, I would start with job boards that have high percentage of jobs I&#8217;m interestd in (i.e. startup jobs).  It was interesting to see Amazon jobs on StackOverflow.  I would use StackOverflow to discover big companies as well.
</p>


<p>
I don&#8217;t use keywords to search.  I just browse.
</p>




<p><strong>
Let’s find a job description.  Please tell me what comes to your mind.
</strong></p>


<p>
Okay, here&#8217;s one that was sent to me by a recruiter - an iOS mobile app development contract position.
</p>


<p></p>
<img src="http://geekology.heroku.com/images/blog_imgs/ios_march_2013_part_1.png" title="iOS Developer part 1" ></p>

<p>
<p>
I don&#8217;t want to read this part (<em>About Us</em> and <em>About Our Culture</em>) at this point.  They shouldn&#8217;t put this at the beginning.  I will only look at this later if I am interested about this position.
</p>

</p>


<p><img src="http://geekology.heroku.com/images/blog_imgs/ios_march_2013_part_2.png" title="iOS Developer part 2" ></p>

<p>
To develop a mobile app for this well-known luxury retailer is exciting because the number of potential users can be huge.  However, the offshore-onshore combo is a turn-off for me because I have been in that situation before and it didn&#8217;t work well.  Also, the requirement to be on-site is not attractive to me.  As a contractor, I&#8217;d prefer to work remotely.
</p>


<p>
Something that is not clear to me is what <em>other native API integration</em> means.
</p>


<p>
In general, this part (<em>About the client and assignment</em>) of the job description is what I would read very carefully.
</p>


<p></p>
<img src="http://geekology.heroku.com/images/blog_imgs/ios_march_2013_part_3.png" title="iOS Developer part 3" ></p>

<p>

<p>
I only scan the <em>Required Skills</em> part.  Mostly I only look at the top 3 items.  For example, the 4th item, the Cocoa requirement, should be moved to the 2nd position.
</p>
<p>
The UI design requirement (the 2nd item) should be moved to a lower position if it&#8217;s not a hard requirement.  Being the 2nd item on the list, it signals to me this job is more front-end and design-focused than the typical iOS development role.
</p>
<p>
I like seeing Test-Driven Development here because it&#8217;s a rare, but important, skill to have.
</p>
<p>
I pretty much ignore the whole <em>Personal Skills</em> part because it&#8217;s all just stardard stuff.  Every single job descriptioin says the same thing.
</p>


<p><strong>
Please rate this job description.
</strong></p>
<p>My overall rating: <strong>Average</strong></p>
<p><strong>
Interest-level heat map of this job description for this engineer:</strong>
(Yellow - interesting.  Grey - not interesting.)

    <link href="http://geekology.heroku.com/blog/2013/03/02/lets-fix-technical-recruiters-bad-name/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-02T23:39:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://geekology.heroku.com/blog/2013/03/02/lets-fix-technical-recruiters-bad-name</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
What‘s the first organic search result in Google when you type in “technical recruiting?”
</p>


<p>
For me, the answer was a blog titled, 
<a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2598-why-are-technical-recruiters-so-clueless">“Why are technical recruiters so clueless?”</a>, by none other than the creator of Ruby on Rails web development framework - David Heinemeier Hansson of 37Signals, known in the software community as DHH.
<!-- More -->In this blog, David Heinemeier Hansson opened with  -
</p>


<blockquote><p>“Are there any recruiters working in technology who get it? Anyone putting in just a minimum of effort to appear even half-way competent? If so, they need to speak up. The reputation of their profession is being soiled by completely clueless hacks.”</p></blockquote>


<p>
DHH then included an actual email that he received from a recruiter, urging him to apply for “a rapidly expanding, VC-funded tech startup positioned squarely on top of the social media marketing revolution.”  Here is an analogy for this situation - 
It’s like a recruiter asking Iron Chef Bobby Flay if he would like to apply for a position at a promising neighborhood eatery, and that his pay would &ldquo;depend on his experience.&rdquo;
</p>


<p>
DHH went on, 
<blockquote><p>“If they’re just going to spam people from emails they find on tech sites, why not just pay some shady Russians to do it? [&#8230;] The problem with this kind of hackery is that it has bred an outright animosity to recruiters in large parts of the tech world.”</p></blockquote>
</p>


<p>
Fast forwarding, the conclusion of his blog was -
<blockquote><p>“As things stand right now, though, I would never recommend the use of recruiters to anyone for a technical position. You’re much more likely to be associated with the incompetence of the recruiter than you are to find highly skilled technical talent.”</p></blockquote>
</p>


<p>
Among the 140+ comments on this blog, many shared similar experience.
</p>


<p>
Having been on both sides (being a programmer and being a recruiter), I understand why the programmers dislike thoughtless and impersonal phone calls and emails.  I also see why recruiters are tempted to skip doing research before contacting programmers.
</p>


<p>
As a developer, you get bombarded with countless generic emails and messages constantly.  It’d be awesome if the positions in these emails actually matched what you looked for in an ideal job.  Unfortunately, 99% of these look nothing interesting, and you can’t stop them from coming.
</p>


<p>
As a recruiter, you wish you could prepare personalized sales pitch for each developer you reach out to and your email would create high level of interest.  But, if you don’t even understand half of what’s in the job description and what these developers have been working on, you simply have no way to know how developers would think about the positions you’re recruiting for.  While constantly being under the tremendous pressure to quickly bring candidates to the hiring managers, you decide to play the “numbers game.”
</p>


<p>
This means, if you saw in the past that you get a 1% response rate, you believe you need to send out emails to 300 developers to get 3 candidates for your hiring manager.  It’s next to impossible for anyone to write 300 personalized emails given the time constraint, so your only option is to blast out a generic email to 300 people.
</p>


<p>
After reading this blog, I felt compelled to find ways to improve this situation and promote better communication and relationships between programmers and recruiters.  Since the recruiters are those who initiate the interaction, here are some proactive steps recruiters can take:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Have a basic level of understanding of technology:</strong> Know what your candidates and hiring mangers spend all day using and go beyond just keyword matching
</li>
<li>
<strong>Understand what technical people value:</strong> Put yourself in technical talent’s shoes and know what is important in their work and career
</li>
<li>
<strong>Be value-add for potential candidates:</strong> Offer job opportunities to developers because these opportunities improve their career, not just because you’ll fill a role or get paid
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Doing these is not only for the developers’ benefits; doing these is also good for the recruiters.  As a recruiter, the most valuable business asset is the relationship you build with people.  Today, there is a short supply of developers.  This shortage will last for the foreseeable future.  This means your ability to connect with technical talent is the most crucial aspect to perform your work.  The only way you can gain developers’ trust is when you put their interest before your own.  Only then will you have a chance of building meaningful relationships with them.
</p>
<p>
I can’t wait to see the day when the technical recruiting profession being widely valued and recognized by the technical talent community as a partner in the software business ecosystem.

    <link href="http://geekology.heroku.com/blog/2013/02/10/what-is-an-sdet/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
If you are a software developer looking for a contract or full-time job with companies like Microsoft, Amazon, etc., you&#8217;ve probably been approached by enough recruiters that asked you if you&#8217;d be interested in working as an SDET. Your first reaction might have been - Testing? No way. <!-- More --> Then, they start talking about how it involves a lot of coding and now you think, &#8220;Now, that&#8217;s different from what I thought about testing.&#8221;
</p>




<p>
If you are a technical recruiter, you might also be a bit unclear about what exactly is a SDET.  You might be wondering, &#8220;Is SDET same as a tester?&#8221;  But, SDETs seem to be requiring just as much coding as software engineers.  Then you ask yourself, &#8220;What skills am I supposed to look for when my hiring manager is looking for a SDET?&#8221;
</p>




<p>
To help demystify SDET, here is a collection of articles that explain what an SDET is and does:

</p>


<p><em></p>

<h3>What is an SDE-T?</h3>

  <li>Programming experience a must
  <ul>
    <li>Key here is that the candidate is a Developer. Strong QA candidates without development experience are generally not acceptable for this role.</li>

        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>

<h3>How to sell the SDE-T role to a developer</h3>


<ul>
  <li>Breadth of experience over narrow focus </li>
  <li>End to end product expertise. From development to user interaction </li>
  <li>Subject Matter Expert on product. Has input on product direction. </li>
  <li>Career &ldquo;big fish in a small pond&rdquo;&hellip; a strong contributor can really make a name for him or herself. Easier than in Dev because do not get &ldquo;pigeon holed&rdquo; and because the QA field is more exclusive.</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://geekology.heroku.com/blog/2013/02/01/what-makes-a-strong-recruiting-team/"/>
    <updated>2013-02-01T22:26:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://geekology.heroku.com/blog/2013/02/01/what-makes-a-strong-recruiting-team</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In order to attract top talent to your organization it is imperative that you have a top-notch recruiting team in place. I often wonder if organizations realize just how important recruiting is to the success of an organization. If an organization does not have the very best recruiting team in place, it can be at a severe competitive disadvantage. The recruiting function is the key driving force in ensuring the right hires made and less than desirable hires are avoided.</p>


<!--More-->


<p>I felt the need to write this piece because I think organizations need to focus more time and effort on assessing potential recruiters. Organizations need to move beyond seeing the recruiter as someone who solely serves a transactional purpose and instead view the recruiter as someone who can have a powerful transformational impact.</p>


<p>Over the years I have heard candidates tell me one recruiting nightmare after another and it has pained me to hear these stories.  I myself have also had some less than favorable recruiting experiences and from these experiences I have learned what not to do as a recruiter.</p>


<p>On a positive note, I have had the opportunity to both work with, and learn from, some truly amazing recruiters. Compiling all of these experiences and data points helped me devise this list of traits I think are important to consider when assessing potential recruiters for your team.</p>


<p>1)      <strong>Hire individuals who are more than mere resume pushers</strong> – Resume pushers send large numbers of resumes to hiring managers without even bothering to screen the candidates. The hiring manager is then left having to do all the work. When a recruiter is a resume pusher, they are not doing his/her job and are definitely not a value-add to the organization. The best recruiters serve as consultants or partners to the business. These recruiters perform due diligence in sourcing candidates, screening candidates, and providing in-depth candidates summaries to hiring managers. If recruiters are consultants versus resume pushers, they will be respected by both candidates and hiring managers.</p>


<p>2)      <strong>Hire individuals who will be evangelists for your organization</strong> – If a recruiter isn’t excited about working for your organization, how can the recruiter get a candidate excited, or at least interested in working for your organization? Candidates often ask the question, “Why should I work for this organization?” If a recruiter can’t give a genuine enthusiastic answer for this question to candidates, you don’t have the right recruiter on-board. As a recruiter you should be able to easily sell your organization to a candidate. You should truly believe in the statement, “I love working for this organization! This is the best organization to work for because of X, Y, Z reasons.”</p>


<p>3)      <strong>Hire recruiters with a competitive spirit – </strong>The very best recruiters are extremely driven and have a strong desire to win. Recruiting can be quite competitive, especially when dealing with highly desirable candidates. As a recruiter at Microsoft I often compete against companies such as Amazon and Google for top talent. When a candidate informed me he or she was also in process with some of these big name players, I get an adrenaline rush because I knew securing the candidate will be a challenge. If recruiters lack this inner competitiveness, they may just allow top candidates to slip away without doing everything in their power to get the candidate.</p>


<p>4)      <strong>Hire hunters versus farmers – </strong>In order to hire top talent for your organization, you need recruiters who will do more than just wait for candidates to submit their resumes on-line. The best candidates are often passive candidates. In order to find these passive candidates, recruiters must go on the hunt for these candidates by cold calling, networking, sourcing, and maintaining long-term relationships with candidates. If recruiters just sit back and wait for resumes to come along, they are missing out on potential A+ candidates.</p>


<p>5)      <strong>Hire individuals who can serve as consultants to the business – </strong>At Microsoft I work with some of the most talented and successful recruiters I have ever met. The reason these recruiters stand out is because they know the business and, as a result, hiring managers and candidates respect them. In order for recruiters to be true consultants, they need to take the time to learn the business. This means spending time learning from hiring managers, reading up on the business, attending presentations, and analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of competitors in the same market.</p>


<p>6)      <strong>Hire individuals who are passionate about recruiting – </strong>When recruiters are passionate about what they do, they often go above and beyond in their jobs. Actually passionate recruiters don’t even see recruiting as a job, they see recruiting as something they love to do, whether they are working or not. The passionate recruiters I have encountered have this positive energy that is contagious. You just know they are successful because of a love for what they do.</p>


<p><strong>7)      </strong><strong>Hire individuals with a high level of emotional intelligence – </strong>Individuals with a high level of emotional intelligence standout because they can easily build relationships with just about anyone. From my experience, recruiting is all about relationship building, both with candidates and hiring managers. Individuals with a high EQ tend to figure out how to connect with people on a personal level, which helps tremendously when you are trying to fully assess someone’s fit for an organization and a specific role within the organization. A high EQ serves a recruiter well because it gives a person an ability to see beyond the obvious and use strong intuition and other soft skills to provide additional feedback on candidates.<strong></strong></p>


<p><strong> </strong><strong>8)      </strong><strong>Hire courageous individuals – </strong>The best recruiters I have met are willing to stand up for their decisions about candidates, even if the rest of the interview team disagrees with them. As a recruiter, it’s important you have an opinion and are willing to make a case for it. You may not always be right, but at least you had the courage to stand by your decision. Also, when it comes to negotiating offers with candidates, a recruiter needs to be confident and firm. If there is no flexibility with the offer and the candidate is pushing back, the recruiter needs to inform the candidate, “This is the very best offer for these reasons.” <strong></strong></p>


<p><strong> 9</strong><strong>) Hire strong communicators – </strong>As a recruiter, your primary responsibility is to communicate regularly with your candidates and hiring managers. Early on in my career, a former boss once said it’s always best to err on the side of over communicating. This advice has stuck with me throughout my career and I am grateful to have received it. My rule of thumb is to never allow more than a week to pass without providing an update to candidates and hiring managers. I have heard of recruiters never getting back to candidates after on-site interviews. Here a candidate takes time off work, possibly even flies to another state for the interview, then never hears the results of the interview. Whether or not you have good news, bad news, or no news, it is your job to keep an ongoing dialogue with candidates and hiring managers. Top-notch recruiters are proactive in their communications and never keep the candidates and hiring managers wondering what is going on.</p>

<p>
In this series, I invite someone to review a real job description with matching or related technical background.  In these reviews, you&#8217;ll learn the unfiltered feedback and thoughts from the technical people who are the target readers of these job descriptions.  Please note: each review reflects only the opinion of the specific reviewer.

<p><strong>Please give us your career summary.</strong></p>


<p>

<ul>
<li>Mobile development</li>

<li>Multi-media</li>
<li>Monetization techniques</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p>My past experience includes</p>

<ul>
<li>QA engineering team building</li>
<li>Windows development</li>
<li>Mac application development</li>
<li>7 years at MS Windows group</li>
</ul>




<p><strong>
What type of jobs are you looking for today? How is it different from your last job?
</strong></p>




<p>
I am looking for positions as such Engineering Manager or Product Manager.  I want to work in a smaller environment because of the variety of work, opportunity to learn, and ability to switch roles (such as from engineering to product management).  What is very important to me is super low barrier to communication and learning.  By this I mean I can easily interact with other roles on the team and within the company.
</p>




<p><strong>
How do you go about conducting your job search?
</strong></p>


<p>
I use Craigslist.  Three of my previous jobs were found via Craigslist.  This time I interviewed for a position at Amazon because of their Craigslist posting.  I didn’t look elsewhere.
</p>




<p><strong>
Why do you like using Craigslist?
</strong></p>


<p>
I feel company websites are too narrow.  I want to see the overall job market and the variety on Craigslist can give me a better idea.  Craigslist is most convenient for me and it has enough positions that I’m interested in, so I don’t feel the need to use job boards or LinkedIn.
</p>


<p>
The reason I don’t use job board or LinkedIn is because
<ol>
<li>Creating accounts at different job boards is a hassle</li>
<li>I’m concerned about privacy and security issues (i.e. my search/view history might be shown).</li>
</ol>
</p>


<p><strong>
How do you find job postings online?
</strong></p>


<p>
I don’t use any keyword search.  I go to Craigslist to scan for interesting items.  Even though I’m looking for engineering manager level positions, I will look at jobs at companies that are doing interesting work.  Then I will go to that company’s own career site to find out more.
</p>


<p><strong>
Let’s find a job description.  Please tell me what comes to your mind.
</strong></p>


<p>
Okay, let’s go to Craigslist.  The top job posting happens to be a QA role, which matches my background.
</p>


<p>
(After about 20 seconds scanning this job description)  Here are the three things that stand out for me:
</p>


<p><img src="http://geekology.heroku.com/images/blog_imgs/QA_JD.png" title="What Stands Out" ></p>

<p>
<ol>
<li>Virtual Machine Engine: It&#8217;s an interesting technology to me.</li>
<li>Virtualization and Coding Theory: Once again, I&#8217;m interested in the technology.</li>
<li>Company info: It&#8217;s good to know the company is profitable, have lots of users and the type of users the company has.</li>
</ol>
</p>


<p>
Everything else is just standard stuff and is pretty boring.
</p>


<p><strong>
Please rate this job description.
</strong></p>


<p>My overall rating: Average of below average - nothing too exciting.</p>

<p>
If you’re a technical recruiter, knowing what’s on your candidate’s mind helps tremendously at every step of your interaction with them.  The better you know what the most important considerations are on their mind, the better chance you have to successfully recruit them.  Here is a list of super power you’ll get when you can “read mind” - <!-- More -->
   <ul>
     <li>
       Having developers return your email or phone call during your initial reach out
     </li>
     <li>
       Sustaining your candidate’s interest level while going through all the testing, qualifying, and interviewing
     </li>
     <li>
       Reaching a win-win outcome during the offer negotiation to bring them on board
     </li>
   </ul>
<p>

<h3>What developers tell you</h3>
<p>
  It turns out this is a hot topic among technical people as well.  Whenever I talk to my fellow developers/engineers, I get many eager responses.  Here is a (long) list of typical answers you’ll get when you ask technical people what they are looking for:
  <ul>
    <li>I like to wear many hats</li>
    <li>No bureaucracy</li>
    <li>A place where I can build something awesome</li>
    <li>I want no politics</li>
    <li>I have ownership in the product</li>
    <li>What I do and how hard I work actually matters</li>
    <li>I have responsible for things that are above my pay grade</li>
    <li>The harder I work, the faster I grow and become rewarded</li>
    <li>I want to be self-directed</li>
    <li>I need a sense of purpose</li>
    <li>I want become even better in what I do</li>
    <li>The team I will work with is important</li>
    <li>I want to solve an important problem (ex: technical challenges, or solves a personal pain point, etc)</li>
    <li>I’m looking for the *opportunity* to make a lot of money via options/equity is exciting</li>
    <li>I’d like to play a key role in defining product/strategy (personal voice and influence)</li>
    <li>I want the right title/role/responsibilities</li>
    <li>I am looking for a sense of freedom (e.g., escape bigger company politics/inefficiencies, more flexibility in schedule, etc)</li>
    <li>Experience (experiential learning, connections, etc) that can lead me to a bigger career goal is important</li>
    <li>Company culture/environment matters a lot</li>
    <li>I am looking for a collaborative environment</li>
    <li>I need variety in my work so I won’t be bored</li>
    <li>The opportunity to be shaping the technical landscape of a product excites me</li>
    <li>I want to be an early engineer at a famous company</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>What they are REALLY saying</h3>
<p>
With a list this long, it’s difficult to keep all these in your head when you interact with your candidates.  The good news is that we can boil them down into four simple categories:
  <ol>
    <li>People
      <ul>
        <li>I want to be belong to a league of smart people</li>
        <li>I want them to like me and recognize my ability and contribution</li>
        <li>I want to learn from smart people I work with and become even smarter</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Work
      <ul>
        <li>I want stimulating and challenging work</li>
        <li>I need to find meaning in my work and see my work make an impact</li>
        <li>I also want to do work that will increase my market value even more</li>
        <li>I want to be constantly learning new technologies and gaining skills</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Reward
      <ul>
        <li>I like to see a direct correlation between effort and reward</li>
        <li>Furthermore, I’m excited about the chance of hitting the “jackpot” by joining the next Facebook</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Autonomy
      <ul>
        <li>The company trust me to make decisions, from technical decisions to my work schedule</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>

<h3>How to use it in your recruiting</h3>
  <p>
Now when we look at this summary, we can see that technical people – developers, software engineers, designers, QA engineers, database architect, DevOps, PMs, etc. – want pretty much the same thing as everyone else.  The difference is that good technical candidates are in a position to choose, so they set the bar pretty high.  This means they expect to find a job that meets ALL of their criteria, because they can.
  </p>
  <p>
Now you knowing the main decision factors of technical talent, incorporate these into all your interactions with your candidates when you recruit them.  For example, saying something like
</p>
<blockquote><p>“In our Big Data SDE role, you get to play with petabytes of data, code up mind-bending machine learning algorithms, and become a master of all things Big Data – Cassandra, Hbase, PIG, Hive, Hadoop, and more.”</p></blockquote>
<p>is a lot more enticing than saying</p>
<blockquote><p>“I have a very good job opportunity. I am attaching the job description. If you are interested, kindly send your updated resume.”</p></blockquote>
  <p>
Intrigue your candidates by mapping the job requirements to what they look for in a job.  When you incorporate this into every piece of communication, your candidates will become a lot more enthusiastic and cooperative.
  </p>

<h3>Getting to a successful hire</h3>
  <p>
These are the basic requirements developers have in their next job.  Be sure you address at least 90%, if not all, of them.   To go beyond the basics, you need to also learn about each candidate’s unique situation.  That’s where the more subjective requirements come into consideration.  Additionally, knowing how your candidates rank their decision factors will be crucial during the negotiation.  These will be in a future blog, “Developer Mind Reading 202.”
